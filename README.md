## **100 Days of DevOps — Roadmap**

---

Here’s how I suggest we structure it:

* **Theme per week** so you build progressively from fundamentals to advanced tools.
* **Daily mini-projects or tasks** so you get hands-on every day.
* **GitHub repo** to track progress and keep a public streak (great for accountability and recruiters).
* **Mix of theory & practice** so you don’t just follow commands blindly.

---


### **Phase 1 — Foundations (Days 1–20)**

* **Linux basics, Shell scripting, Networking, Git/GitHub**
* Daily: Commands, scripts, and small automation tasks.
* Outcome: Comfort in CLI, scripting, and version control.

### **Phase 2 — Containers (Days 21–35)**

* **Docker, Images, Volumes, Networks, Docker Compose**
* Daily: Build, run, and orchestrate containers.
* Outcome: Deploy multi-container apps locally.

### **Phase 3 — Infrastructure as Code (Days 36–50)**

* **Terraform, Ansible**
* Daily: Provision & configure infrastructure automatically.
* Outcome: Spin up servers and services with code.

### **Phase 4 — CI/CD (Days 51–65)**

* **Jenkins, GitHub Actions**
* Daily: Automate build, test, and deployment pipelines.
* Outcome: Fully automated workflow for apps.

### **Phase 5 — Cloud Platforms (Days 66–80)**

* **AWS, Azure, GCP basics**
* Daily: Deploy apps on cloud VMs, S3, and managed services.
* Outcome: Comfort deploying in any cloud.

### **Phase 6 — Monitoring & Security (Days 81–90)**

* **Prometheus, Grafana, ELK, Security best practices**
* Daily: Set up dashboards, alerts, and security hardening.
* Outcome: Proactive monitoring and secure setups.

### **Phase 7 — Final Project (Days 91–100)**

* **End-to-end DevOps project**
* Pick an app → Containerize → Deploy with IaC → Set up CI/CD → Monitor → Document.
* Outcome: Portfolio-worthy, interview-ready project.
